Read an input set of 2D integer points in a coordinate plane.
The goal is to find the median coordinate point, whose 𝑥-coordinate is equal to the median of
the 𝑥-coordinates of the input points and its 𝑦-coordinate is equal to the median of their 𝑦-
coordinates. Finding the median 𝑥- and 𝑦-coordinates is done by sorting the points separately
by the corresponding coordinate.

We make the following two assumptions:
a) All input points have integer coordinates ranging between −50 and 50 inclusive.
b)The input points may have duplicates.
